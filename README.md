### Ticket Breakdown: OfficeServiceTest Implementation

**1. Set up the testing class and basic structure**
   - **Task:** Create the `OfficeServiceTest` class within the appropriate `test` package. 
   - **Details:** Ensure that the class is annotated with `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` to support Mockito in your tests. Set up class-level annotations like `@SpringBootTest` to enable Spring Boot context loading. Initialize mock dependencies for `OfficeRepository` and `OfficeService` using `@Mock` and `@InjectMocks`.
   - **Goal:** The class should be correctly configured to mock dependencies and inject them into the service for testing.

**2. Write the setup method**
   - **Task:** Implement a setup method to initialize common test data (e.g., `Doctor` and `Office` objects).
   - **Details:** Use `@BeforeEach` to create and configure reusable objects like a mock `Doctor` and `Office`. Make sure the `Doctor` is assigned as a field in `Office`, and all key fields are populated with appropriate dummy values.
   - **Goal:** Ensure that common data is available for each test, reducing duplication across test methods.

**3. Implement the createOffice test**
   - **Task:** Write a unit test to validate the creation of an `Office`.
   - **Details:** Test that when `createOffice` is called, it interacts correctly with `OfficeRepository`. Mock the repository's `create` method to ensure it's called with the expected input. Verify the result returned from the service matches the mocked repository's behavior.
   - **Goal:** Ensure the creation logic is correctly handled by `OfficeService` and that it interacts with `OfficeRepository`.

**4. Implement the updateOffice test**
   - **Task:** Create a test that verifies the updating of an `Office`.
   - **Details:** Test that calling `updateOffice` will invoke the appropriate repository methods. Mock the retrieval of an existing office, ensure changes are applied, and verify that the `OfficeRepository.update` method is called. Assert that the update behaves as expected.
   - **Goal:** Ensure the service's update logic works as intended and interacts with the repository correctly.

**5. Implement the deleteOffice test**
   - **Task:** Write a unit test to check the deletion of an `Office`.
   - **Details:** Ensure that when `o` is called, it interacts with the repository’s delete method. Mock the repository's behavior and confirm that the service correctly passes the office ID to the `delete` method. Test for proper exception handling when the office does not exist.
   - **Goal:** Verify that the delete logic correctly interacts with the repository and handles scenarios like missing offices.

**6. Implement the retrieval of Office by ID test**
   - **Task:** Test the retrieval of an `Office` by its ID.
   - **Details:** Ensure that the `getOfficeById` method interacts with the repository to retrieve an office based on the given ID. Use mocks to simulate repository responses. Assert that the returned office matches the expected result from the mock.
   - **Goal:** Ensure that the service correctly retrieves offices by their ID.

**7. Add a Parameterized Test for office creation**
   - **Task:** Write a `@ParameterizedTest` to validate office creation with various valid office names.
   - **Details:** Create a `@ParameterizedTest` using `@CsvSource` to test office creation with different valid office names (e.g., "Main Office", "Branch Office"). Verify that the `createOffice` method accepts these names and interacts with the repository correctly.
   - **Goal:** Ensure that the office creation logic handles multiple valid inputs as expected.

**8. Verify proper exception handling in edge cases**
   - **Task:** Add tests that check the behavior when invalid data is provided or when operations fail (e.g., creating an office with a missing doctor).
   - **Details:** Use Mockito to simulate repository failures or invalid input conditions. Ensure that the service throws the appropriate exceptions and handles edge cases gracefully.
   - **Goal:** Ensure that the service properly manages errors and invalid conditions, providing meaningful exceptions where necessary.

**9. Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all public methods**
   - **Task:** Review all public methods in the `OfficeService` class and verify that each is covered by unit tests.
   - **Details:** Go through the service methods and ensure that all possible scenarios (successful execution, failure cases, edge cases) are tested. Refactor or extend tests where necessary to achieve comprehensive coverage.
   - **Goal:** Ensure the class is fully covered by unit tests, with clear assertions validating all functional paths.
